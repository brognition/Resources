Resources and starter kits for B&amp;C Lab

## Github

GitHub isn't just for software developers—it’s a powerful tool for **collaboration, version control, transparency, and reproducibility** in scientific research. Whether you're managing behavioral experiments, analyzing EEG data, or writing manuscripts, GitHub can streamline your workflow and make it easier to collaborate with colleagues.

Check out our [How-To Guide](https://github.com/brognition/Resources/wiki/How-to-GitHub-%E2%80%90-The-Basics) for using Github in the B&C Lab.

## Coding

Writing good code is an essential part of doing high-quality, credible science. Clean, well-documented code allows your analyses to be understood, evaluated, and reproduced—core values of the scientific process. It also makes your work more robust and less prone to error, especially as projects grow in complexity. From a professional standpoint, developing strong coding practices builds transferable skills that open doors across disciplines, enhances collaboration, and helps you become a more independent and effective researcher.

Check out these Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) guides to good code:

- [SOP - Python](https://github.com/brognition/Resources/wiki/SOP-%E2%80%90-Python)
- [SOP - MATLAB](https://github.com/brognition/Resources/wiki/SOP-%E2%80%90-MATLAB)
